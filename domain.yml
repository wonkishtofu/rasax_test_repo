  utter_FAQ-using_RFP_and_not_tenders_1:
  - text: "A Request for Proposal (RFP) is a procurement approach to communicate outcome-based\
      \ requirements and where the proposal that most closely fits the needs and budget\
      \ is selected, or where it is not industry practice to tender for the items.\n"
  utter_FAQ-using_RFP_and_not_tenders_2:
  - text: "While RFP allows for diversity in proposals submitted and for discussion\
      \ and changes in scope, you must note that evaluation of proposals will be more\
      \ challenging as you are not comparing like-for-like.  So for the straight forward\
      \ buys, where requirements are standard and there is no need for innovation,\
      \ tender is still the best method to employ.\n"
  utter_FAQ-using_RFP_and_not_tenders_3:
  - text: "The same principles and procedure for calling tenders also apply to RFP.\n"
  utter_FAQ-approval_process_honorarium_1:
  - text: "All of the following conditions are to be met for honorarium:a) The party\
      \ is providing the services out of goodwill (e.g. no fees/charges/favours requested)\
      \ b) There is no intent to form a contractual relationship c) There will not\
      \ be any agreement which will bind both parties legally d) The honorarium given\
      \ is not agreed upon upfront\n"
  utter_FAQ-approval_process_honorarium_2:
  - text: "Please put up an expenditure paper for the honorarium (which will require\
      \ Fin's support) and address these conditions in your paper to provide proper\
      \ justification for giving honorarium, including the quantum.\n"
  utter_FAQ-approval_process_honorarium_3:
  - text: Hope that helped!
  utter_FAQ-rules_for_giving_honorarium_1:
  - text: "An honorarium is a payment for a service which has been done ex gratia\
      \ or  which fees are not legally required. Since the payment is made without\
      \ the giver  recognising any liability or legal obligation (i.e. there is no\
      \ contract between URA and the receiver), this is not considered procurement\
      \ and would not be subject to  the IM on Procurement rules and procedures.\n"
  utter_FAQ-rules_for_giving_honorarium_2:
  - text: "The honorarium amount could be a token sum as a form of appreciation, or\
      \ an amount to cover the necessary expenditure (e.g. hotel, air tickets) incurred\
      \ by the speaker. While there are no guidelines on the IM with regard to the\
      \ amount, individual agencies shall ensure there are adequate  internal controls\
      \ in place to approve the amount.\n"
  utter_FAQ-rules_for_giving_honorarium_3:
  - text: "Please note that if URA choose to procure the speakerâ€™s necessary accommodation\
      \ and air tickets,  procurement rules will apply for the procurement of the\
      \ accommodation and air tickets.\n"
