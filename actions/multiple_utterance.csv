faq/FAQ-using RFP and not tenders,"A Request for Proposal (RFP) is a procurement approach to communicate
outcome-based requirements and where the proposal that most closely fits
the needs and budget is selected, or where it is not industry practice
to tender for the items.","While RFP allows for diversity in proposals submitted and for discussion
and changes in scope, you must note that evaluation of proposals will be
more challenging as you are not comparing like-for-like.  So for the
straight forward buys, where requirements are standard and there is no
need for innovation, tender is still the best method to employ.",The same principles and procedure for calling tenders also apply to RFP.
faqm/FAQ-approval process honorarium,"All of the following conditions are to be met for honorarium:a) The
party is providing the services out of goodwill (e.g. no
fees/charges/favours requested) b) There is no intent to form a
contractual relationship c) There will not be any agreement which will
bind both parties legally d) The honorarium given is not agreed upon
upfront","Please put up an expenditure paper for the honorarium (which will
require Fin's support) and address these conditions in your paper to
provide proper justification for giving honorarium, including the
quantum.",Hope that helped!
faqm/FAQ-rules for giving honorarium,"An honorarium is a payment for a service which has been done ex gratia
or which fees are not legally required. Since the payment is made
without the giver recognising any liability or legal obligation (i.e.
there is no contract between URA and the receiver), this is not
considered procurement and would not be subject to the IM on Procurement
rules and procedures.","The honorarium amount could be a token sum as a form of appreciation, or
an amount to cover the necessary expenditure (e.g. hotel, air tickets)
incurred by the speaker. While there are no guidelines on the IM with
regard to the amount, individual agencies shall ensure there are
adequate internal controls in place to approve the amount.","        Please note that if URA choose to procure the speaker’s necessary
        accommodation and air tickets, procurement rules will apply for the
        procurement of the accommodation and air tickets."
